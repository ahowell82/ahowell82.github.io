				<div class='announce' id=1>What happens to the dues we pay for BWPTA?</div>
				<div class='details'>Your dues payments provide each individual with membership into our local Backwoods PTA, the County Council PTA, as well as the State and National PTA.  Membership dues also entitle each member to a copy of the student directory.</div>
				<hr>
				<div class='announce' id=2>Do I have to come to school to volunteer?</div>
				<div class='details'>No.  There are many committees and projects within the PTA that can be completed without physically being in the school.</div>
				<hr>
				<div class='announce' id=3>How often does the PTA meet?</div>
				<div class='details'>The Backwoods PTA General Membership Meetings are held during the last week of every other month.  Go to the <a href="PTAMeetings.html" >PTA Meetings</a> page for more information.</div>
				<hr>
				<div class='announce' id=4>Can I volunteer even if I am unable to come to the meetings?</div>
				<div class='details'>Yes.  While we encourage members to attend meetings and stay informed, attendance to meetings is not required to volunteer.</div>
				<hr>
				<div class='announce' id=5>How does the PTA raise money at Backwoods Elementary?</div>
				<div class='details'>Backwoods PTA holds several fundraising events throughout the school year.  Go to the <a href="events.html" >Events</a> page for more information on our fundraisers.</div>
				<hr>
				<div class='announce' id=6>What does the PTA do with the funds raised?</div>
				<div class='details'>The Backwoods PTA uses funds to offset the cost of many things that would normally be asked of parents/guardians.  Our funds pay for all field trip costs and admission fees for students and chaperones.  Funds raised pay for the family events we hold annually.  Student agendas are provided by the PTA.  All Cultural Arts programs held during the school year are paid for by the PTA.  These are just some of the items that BWPTA funds pay for annually.</div>
